# MICS2025
Code for the MICS 2025 programming competition from my team, we placed 3rd.

Team Name: Royale w Cheese
Team Members:
- Carter Gordon
- Andrew Smith
- Eddie French

This was a programming competition held alongside a Robotics competition we attended as well. Of the 9 problems total we were able to solve 7, and we had the fewest validation attempts out of all teams.
